# Deisotoping_Lipidomics_CC_Celegans

This pipeline was used for the deisotoping correction of the lipidomic data shown in: Cadena del Castillo , et. al. under review. A preview of this research article can be found in: Cadena del Castillo , et. al.2019. BioarXiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/816256

The pipeline requires two initial datasets from the lipidomics analysis (provided in the datasets folder) and outputs a merged dataset containing the +2 correction.
